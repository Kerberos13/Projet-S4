In order to launch the software, two options are currently available. You can either run it directly in a console by typing "python main.py <file_path>" where <file_path> is the relative path to the spectrogram, or run it via the Graphical User Interface by typing "python ProjetS4.py".

It is expected that your spectrogram is in the folder "spectrograms/". Splitted images of signals and final analyzed spectrogram are available in the "tmp/" folder depending on the stage of the calculation.

Python is highly sensitive to indentation. Current files are written with an indentation of four spaces. If you happen to modify something in one or several of those files, please respect this indentation system or it will not compile.

This software has some dependencies and needs several items to be installed in order to work: Python 3 (should work on Python 2 though, but not tested yet), numpy, PIL.
